## Description
A simple Arduino project that blinks an LED connected to pin 13 on and off at 1-second intervals.

## Components
Arduino Board \
LED \
Resistor (220 ohms) \
Jumper wires 

## Circuit Diagram
Connect the positive leg of the LED to pin 13.\
Connect the negative leg of the LED to a 220-ohm resistor.\
Connect the other end of the resistor to the ground (GND).

## Algorithm
Initialize pin 13 as an output.\
Turn the LED on.\
Wait for 1 second.\
Turn the LED off.\
Wait for 1 second.\
Repeat the loop.
