## Description
A simple Arduino project that blinks an LED connected to pin 13 on and off at 1-second intervals.

## Components
-Arduino Board \
-LED \
-Resistor (220 ohms) \
-Jumper wires 

## Circuit Diagram
-Connect the positive leg of the LED to pin 13.\
-Connect the negative leg of the LED to a 220-ohm resistor.\
-Connect the other end of the resistor to the ground (GND).

## Algorithm
1.Initialize pin 13 as an output.\
2.Turn the LED on.\
3.Wait for 1 second.\
4.Turn the LED off.\
5.Wait for 1 second.\
6.Repeat the loop.
