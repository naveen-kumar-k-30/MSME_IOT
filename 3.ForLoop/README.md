## Description
Turn on six LEDs one by one and then turn them off in reverse order using a for loop.

## Components
-Arduino Board \
-6 LEDs \
-Resistors (220 ohms) \
-Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram
-Connect the positive legs of the LEDs to pins 1 through 6. \
-Connect the negative legs of the LEDs to 220-ohm resistors. \
-Connect the other ends of the resistors to the ground (GND).

## Algorithm
1.Initialize pins 1 through 6 as outputs. \
2.Turn on each LED one by one with a 1-second delay. \
3.Turn off each LED in reverse order with a 1-second delay. \
4.Repeat the loop.
