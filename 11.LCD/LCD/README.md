## Description
Display a custom message on a 16x2 LCD screen using an Arduino. This project demonstrates how to interface an LCD with Arduino and display text.

## Components
Arduino Board\
16x2 LCD Display\
Potentiometer\
Resistors (220 ohms)\
Jumper wires\
Breadboard

## Circuit Diagram
Connect the pins of the LCD display to the Arduino as follows:\
VSS to GND\
VDD to 5V\
V0 to the middle pin of the potentiometer\
RS to digital pin 12\
RW to GND\
E to digital pin 11\
D4 to digital pin 5\
D5 to digital pin 4\
D6 to digital pin 3\
D7 to digital pin 2\
A to 5V through a resistor\
K to GND

## Algorithm
Initialize the LCD library and set the LCD dimensions (16x2).\
Set up the LCD and print a custom message.\
Continuously update the display as needed in the loop function.
