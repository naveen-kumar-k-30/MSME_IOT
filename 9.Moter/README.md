## Description
Control the speed and direction of a DC motor using an Arduino and a motor driver. This project demonstrates how to interface a motor driver with Arduino to control a motor.

## Components
Arduino Board\
DC Motor\
Motor Driver Module (L298N or similar)\
Power Supply (appropriate for the motor)\
Jumper wires\
Breadboard

## Circuit Diagram
Connect the motor driver to the Arduino as follows:\
IN1 and IN2 pins of the motor driver to digital pins (e.g., pins 8 and 9).\
ENA (enable) pin of the motor driver to a PWM pin (e.g., pin 10).\
Connect the motor terminals to the motor output pins of the driver.\
Connect the power supply to the motor driver and ensure the ground is common with the Arduino.

## Algorithm
Initialize the motor driver pins as outputs.\
Set the motor speed using PWM signals.\
Control the motor direction by setting the IN1 and IN2 pins appropriately.\
Continuously adjust the motor speed and direction based on input or predefined conditions in the loop function.
