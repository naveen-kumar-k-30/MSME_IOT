## Description
Control the movement of an object or cursor on a display using a joystick module connected to an Arduino. This project can be used for various interactive applications like gaming or navigation.

## Components
Arduino Board\
Joystick Module\
LED (optional for indication)\
Resistors (220 ohms)\
Jumper wires\
Breadboard

## Circuit Diagram
Connect the VRx pin of the joystick to analog pin A0.\
Connect the VRy pin of the joystick to analog pin A1.\
Connect the SW (switch) pin to a digital pin (e.g., pin 2).\
Connect the GND pin to ground (GND).\
Connect the VCC pin to 5V.

## Algorithm
Read the analog values from the joystick's X and Y axes.\
Determine the direction of movement based on the analog values.\
Optionally, read the state of the joystick's switch button.\
Update the position of the object or cursor based on joystick input.\
Continuously check and respond to joystick input in the loop function.
